varStruct is a variational reimplementation of the Structure algorithm by Pritchard et al. varStruct handles multi-allelic loci.

You can compile varStruct from source by using the provided makefile, by executing the command "make"

Usage instructions:

usage: ./varstruct -d <data-file> -o <output prefix> -k <number of pops> -r <random seed> -n <number of individuals> -m <number of loci> -p <ploidy>

<data-file> is a file containing the genotype data in Structure format. Its format is as follows:
===========================================================================
Let N be the number of individuals, M be the number of loci and P be the ploidy. Then there are P lines per individual, each line containing 6+M entries separated by spaces. The first six columns are ignored. Missing genotypes are represented using the value -9.
===========================================================================
The data file has N*P lines in total, each with 6+M columns

<output prefix> is the prefix for output file. The output files will have names <output prefix>.final.* 

<number of pops> is the number of ancestral populations that you want to infer from the data.

<random seed> is the OPTIONAL random seed that is used to randomly initialize the inference.

Output:
The program outputs the value of the inferred ancestry proportions as well as the model parameters. They are stored in the files with the following suffixes:

.theta - The inferred ancestry proportions, one line per individual.

.beta - The ancestral allele frequency matrix.

.centroids - The allele centroids \mu.

.general - The first line stores the number of populations K, the number of loci M, and the ploidy of the data P.
This is followed by M lines. Each lines contains a single number describing how many ancestral loci are present at that loci.

Other notes:
1) To obtain the best model (for a given number of populations), run the program multiple times with different values for the random seed.
